# Project 2 Batcher-Banyan-Network

IFT 510 Principles of Computer Information and Technology Architecture - Project Assignment 2 Submission

## Question
Create a computer program in the language of your choice that emulates a Banyan-Batcher-Network with 8x8 Inputs & Outputs. Then scale the output to 16x16 Delta Network. Use a random generator with 8 or 16 options to emulate the input table routing list with the assigned input port. Show that your simulation works for all inputs and outputs. Explain how your routing fabric changes when you have 16 inputs and outputs.

Make a video presentation that demonstrates how your network works. Submission - a youtube video link or MP4 file

## Deliverables
- Develop the expected values of any tests conducted that demonstrate how your program functions
- Provide a copy of your source code
- Provide a sequence of screenshots in the video to demonstrate the simulation and how the network works for all inputs and outputs (0-7). Ensure to separate the batcher sorter from the banyan network and how they work in conjunction.
- Provide a detailed discussion of results and the concepts you used in developing the program. Discussions should include analysis and a comparison of the results with the expected value from the theory.
- Present the results in the video file and submit
